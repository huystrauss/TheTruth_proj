                    Paul warned in <strong>Galatians 1:6-12</strong> that be careful anyone preach wrong Gospel: <br><br>
                    "I marvel that ye are so soon removed from him that called you into the grace of Chrst unto another gospel: <br>
                    Which is not another; but there be some that trouble you, and would pervert the gospel of Christ. <br>
                    But though we, or an angel from heaven, preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have preached unto you, let him be accursed. <br>
                    As we said before, so say I now again, if any man preach any other gospel unto you than that ye have received, let him be accursed. <br>
                    For do I now persuade men, or God? or do I seek to please men? for if I yet pleased men, I should not be the servant of Christ. <br>
                    But I certify you, brethren, that the gospel which was preached of me is not after man. <br>
                    For I neither received it of man, neither was I taught it, but by the revelation of Jesus Christ."
