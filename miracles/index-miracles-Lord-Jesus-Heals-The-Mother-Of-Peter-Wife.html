            </h2>
            <p>
                When Jesus came into Peter’s home, He saw his mother-in-law lying sick in bed with a fever. 
                He touched her hand, and the fever left her; and she got up and waited on Him. 
                When evening came, they brought to Him many who were demon-possessed; 
                and He cast out the spirits with a word, and healed all who were ill. 
                This was to fulfill what was spoken through Isaiah the prophet: 
                “HE HIMSELF TOOK OUR INFIRMITIES AND CARRIED AWAY OUR DISEASES.”
