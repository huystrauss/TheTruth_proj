            <p>
                And when he was entered into a ship, his disciples followed him. <br><br>
                And, behold, there arose a great tempest in the sea, insomuch that the 
                ship was covered with the waves: but he was asleep. <br><br>
                And his disciples came to him, and awoke him, saying, Lord, save us: we perish. <br><br>
                And he saith unto them, Why are ye fearful, O ye of little faith? Then he arose, 
                and rebuked the winds and the sea; and there was a great calm.  <br><br>
                But the men marvelled, saying, What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him!
